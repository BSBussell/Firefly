        "I hang out with them, they're pretty cool, and really like being bouncy.",
        "They probably haven't told you, but they really like being bounced on. They say it is kinda like a massage or like popping your back or something.",
        "But I have to be careful, because well, I'm not made of the softest material, and sometimes I hurt them.",
        "It's hard being different from all my friends.",
        "Sorry, if it's weird of me to ask but, you can't fly can you?",
        "All the other fireflies are always flying around, but I watched you bounce around, and not once have you flown.",
        "Is, it lonely being a firefly who can't fly? I imagine it would be pretty lonely watching everyone else fly.",
        "I've never been able to fly, but sometimes even when I'm hanging out with all these slimes, I feel a little lonely too.",
        "But I feel I still have a place here I guess. Somehow I still feel I belong here.",
        "Sorry, I'm probably rambling on, it's really nice that you've listened to me. If you want I can give you this jar of fireflies.",
        "I found it around, and I've not really known what to do with it."

    "Ok, so I know most fireflies already know this, but I'm just writing it down for posterity right. So barebones, the faster we go the more we start to [color=yellow]GLOW![/color]",

    "So, pretty much what happens is we zip around and zoom through the air, and as we do so the legends say our [color=yellow]Meter[/color] begins fillin' up.",

    "Now, I might not know what a [color=yellow]meter[/color] is, but when I start movin' eventually I'm able to power on my [color=yellow]light[/color] for a few seconds.",

    "And while I'm [color=yellow]glowing[/color] it's like suddenly I'm able to move faster than I ever could before!",

    "It's always hard to explain to the larvae how to start [color=yellow]glowing[/color], some of the elders say I have to [color=yellow]'press shift'[/color] or whatever that means.",

    "But really it's just like moving your [color=yellow]eyebrows[/color]. It's just a muscle you gotta find and use.",

    "OH! And the most important part, when I'm [color=yellow]glowing[/color], sometimes I've realized that if I can [color=yellow]keep moving[/color], I can keep [color=yellow]glowing[/color] for longer and longer.",

    "It's like some sort of feedback loop where the faster I go the more I can [color=yellow]glow[/color], and the more I [color=yellow]glow[/color] the faster I can go!",

    "So yeah, that's how fireflies [color=yellow]glow[/color]."

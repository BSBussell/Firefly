	"If you have any feedback, please reach out to me through some channel, either from the itch.io page or the Community Discord server.",

	"In the meanwhile, the game comes with a speedrun timer, and there is a running leaderboard that I'd love to see your name on!.",

	"So if you'd like to restart your progress and go for a better time, enable the timer in the settings menu.",

	"Then press [color=yellow]'~' + 'Delete'[/color] keys to restart the game to the very beginning. Or you could just use your current runs time if you're happy with it!",

	"Good Luck, and Thank you for playing!"

    "[color=red]Violets's Tips #2[/color] If you're having trouble with slide boosting, I have a handful of checks that might help you out.",

    "First make sure you're holding the direction you want to launch when you jump. Yes, you have to do this while holding down.",

    "This might be really hard on controllers, but pro-tip, you can actually bind a different button to down.",
    
    "You can do this through the settings menu by pausing! I heard there's a Bee out there who prefers [color=yellow]right trigger.[/color]",

    "So you [color=yellow]hold the direction[/color] you want to go, hold your [color=yellow]slide button[/color], and then [color=yellow]jump![/color]",
    
    "That's only what 3 buttons total! It might be a lil tough but I bet you can get the rhythm down!",
    
    "And here's what they really don't want you to know. You can even slide when on flat ground!",
    
    "The only requirement, is that you're moving fast enough to be sliding. It just happens hills help you move that fast.",
    
    "Slide boosting on flat ground can help you find silly shortcuts, clearly not intended by those who laid the trail. So I highly endorse mastering the trick."

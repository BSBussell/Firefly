	"Ok, so you want to know more about Glowing? If you think you got it feel free to continue. But if you're hungry for the nitty gritty, I got the deets.",

	"So, pretty much we have this meter right, your probably see it in the corner. Everytime you accelerate quickly, either through jumping, sliding, boosting, etc. The meter begins to fill up.",

	"When the meter fills up all the way you will begin glowing. This essentially upgrades all your movement, letting you jump further, faster, and well more recklessly. Its fun but precarious.",

	"But that meter doesn't stay filled up. Over time, the meter will begin to decay, and when your meter hits 0 you will lose your current glow level.",

	"Oh yea, so there's two different levels of glowing. There is glow, and then there is [color=yellow]SUPER-GLOW.[/color]",

	"You reach [color=yellow]SUPER-GLOW[/color] by continuing to accelerate even when you already have glow! [color=yellow]SUPER-GLOW[/color] is even faster than glow, but far more precarious.",

	"If at any point you don't want to power down your glow, press [demote] and you will decrease one tier of glow, and the remaining glow will be chaneled into a burst of speed.",

	"If you don't need or want that speed at the time then don't hold any direction and the energy will just be discarded.",

	"If you would like glow to work where you have to toggle promotion, simply turn of Auto-Glow in settings. Then to upgrade to a tier of glowing you simple press [promote]."
